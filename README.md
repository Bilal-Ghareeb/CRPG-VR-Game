# Game Lore & Story :scroll:
In a post-apocalyptic world, after most humans implanted super intelligence chips in their brains, fearing the development of frightening artificial intelligence, it is now artificial intelligence that takes care of human beings. In 2023, after the world suffered from the scourge of economic disasters and the collapse of entire countries, the idea of a joint government arose, which brings together a council of senior businessmen, scholars and influencers, each of whom has a voice and no voice is louder than theirs. With time, the joint government began to expand little by little until it included nine tenths of the world, so there was no fly left that did not carry the flag of the government and glorify its name while flying over the piles of garbage. In those days, what was known as buying and selling changed its concept completely. The amount of what you touch does not determine what you are able to do, but rather the amount of what is presented, for whom? To the council...to the government...to the archduke! who is that? Oh, sorry, I forgot to tell you that the same council now issues its decision with the signature of a person called the Archduke, who does not have a specific name. Excuse me, I went a little farther, but its worth it... I promise you, with the passage of time the Archduke issued a compulsory order that all those over twenty-five should implant electronic chips, and those under that age would only be satisfied with implanting miniature copies of those chips, provided that they are replaced at the age of thirty with suitable ones To them, you will not fly to carry money anymore, and you will not need a mobile phone, you can be whoever you want wherever you want, but there is a small price for that, those chips, my dear, determine your location and carry with them the strict rules of the government that if you do not follow them, you will not wait for the police to arrest you, Oh, a moment I forgot to tell you that they are no longer needed in the first place. When you break one of those rules, electricity will run through your veins to paralyze you until government drones choke, it's that simple. My grandfather was laughing, remembering his grandfather who used to say to him (everything beautiful has an end). His neck and the last of his feet have grown, there are those whose eyes swelled until they became larger than their head itself, but the damage occurred only to those over twenty-five it seems that a malfunction occurred and that someone had played on the main computer with the adult chips, but fortunately the children's chips were in a server completely separate from them, so they were not affected.
The few remaining humans have invested in what is more lasting, developing robots with only one goal, keeping the young alive. While the numbers of those over twenty were decreasing, the number of robots was increasing and even lengthening. The first robots realized that young people would be terrified of the forms of iron machines that are not equipped to care for children. Computers have skins, voices and feelings. They have become human in every sense of the word, but they are still under one rule. Namely, "preserving the human race." The robots quickly built bases in which they collected children according to their age, and those bases became a haven for every human child wanted to survive. Unfortunately, the last generation of humans did not provide these machines with orders to end these monsters, and they focused on the survival of those who remained, and now inside those buildings a new plot is being hatched in secret. Not all children's slides are intact. In the end, what was implanted for children were miniature copies, and the government's interest in them at the time was much less than that of adults, so there was a percentage of them that were damaged, or what was later known as the "Error Section". The robots automatically classified the children and separated those with healthy chips from the defective children, who in turn had no connection to the server responsible for activating the chip services.

The story begins when a child from the Error Section wakes up in an urgent call, it seems that the shadows of the past are starting to return again and that an event has hacked the children's main computer and it is only a matter of time until they turn into monsters like their predecessors, soon a robot enters to evacuate the children from the Error Section To safety whose whereabouts only a few robots know.
